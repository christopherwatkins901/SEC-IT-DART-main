## Incident Response with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository leverages the versatility of Jupyter Notebooks for incident response in cybersecurity. While Jupyter is traditionally associated with data science, its web-based, code-plus-documentation approach makes it a powerful tool for incident response as well.

### Features

- **Log Queries**: Perform advanced queries on logs like CloudTrail, DNS, and Security Lake using AWS Athena.
  
- **Automated Responses**: Utilize AWS and non-AWS APIs to automate key incident response tasks, such as deactivating access keys.
  
- **Documentation**: Combine code and Markdown cells to create comprehensive playbooks that detail both the steps and the code needed for incident response.

By integrating code, queries, and documentation into a single, interactive environment, these notebooks serve as a complete toolkit for security analysts and incident responders.
